# Awesome Open Frames

Open Frames is an interoperable [standard](https://github.com/open-frames/standard) extending the original Frames specification to support a broader range of applications and protocols.

Getting started with Open Frames is very easy. You need to go through 2 steps:

1. **Update Your Frame's Metadata**: Ensure it aligns with Open Frames standards for seamless integration.
2. **Verifying requests**: Familiarize yourself with your framework's documentation to validate and ensure compatibility.

- For more information go to the official [specification](https://github.com/open-frames/standard).
